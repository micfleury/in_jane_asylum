Houston is still sitting at his desk reading the file when Anna enters, trying to free herself from the grip of Travis.

She is almost shouting, "I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to me! you forget yourself--you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you please."

Travis looks at Houston, "I don't know what she's talking about, Doc. I didn't say anything to her."

"I believe you, Travis. Don't worry about it. Thanks."

Travis, looking both frightened by Anna and relieved by the doctor's words, hurries out.

Houston gestures to Anna indicating she should sit in the chair across from him, "Good afternoon, Anna. How was your night? I wanted to discuss our treatment plan for while you're here," he begins to read from his notes, "We're going to be meeting once a week in group, and that will happen tomorrow. On the other days, we will meet privately. While we ask for confidentiality in group, there is no repercussion if someone breaks it. Here, however, in our sessions, you can be assured that what you say will not leave this room. Do you understand?" Houston looks up.

Anna has not sat down and in fact is exactly where Travis left her, "Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it."

Houston starts to correct her when he notices that her eyes are not entirely fixed upon him. But instead, they look just beyond him -- almost as if he could lean back into her line of vision. 

Although he hadn't managed even a full sentence, Anna answers, "It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself too clear."

Houston stares at her a moment, "Anna. Please, there is no Mr. Elton here. There's only you and I. Can we speak about you for a moment?"

Anna smiles gently as if to agree, but then starts her tirade again, "Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express."

Houston gives up and simply starts speaking over her, "Anna. I want to talk about what happened when these episodes started. I understand that you were upset about your father's death. Did you feel a need cut yourself off from your sister too? Can you hear me? Anna, I know you think that you're escaping your problems, but they're still there."

Anna does not reply so Houston sits quietly, hoping to wait her out. 

For the briefest moment, she looks directly at him, and he thinks that she might be about to break character. She is not, "Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions."

Suddenly, the office door opens. Houston stands and sees George standing in the doorway, naked but for one slipper and a watch, "We have an appointment, right?" George smiles and Houston forces one in response. 

He points to the wall clock, "Not for another forty-five minutes, George."

George looks at the watch on his wrist, "Oh, sorry, Doc. I'm not exactly used to wearing this thing."

Or anything, Houston thinks to himself, "Well, it's nice that you're making an effort for our meetings. I'll see you in a little while, okay?"

"Sure thing," George says, "Catch you in a bit." He closes the door behind him. 

Anna had been staring at George with a mixture of confusion and fear. She pulls her legs up to her chest and hugs them while crying silently. Houston attempts to get her attention, but to no avail. He sighs and sits back down at his desk.

Houston sits at the breakfast bar at Holly's house while she prepares dinner. He is massaging his own neck in an attempt to erase the day. It's usual for them to talk about work, possibly because they don't have anything else in common.

"I think we may have to start sewing George into his clothes. Can't you do anything about him?" Holly asks.

Houston snorts, "Maybe we should just have him transferred to a nudist camp."

Holly hands him a glass of wine "Speaking of camp...did you talk to Ashford about vacation schedules? My family is renting the cabin again this summer and you'd love it. It's on a lake...really relaxing."

Houston can remember that this is the third time she's asked, but can't seem to remember to put in for his vacation time. "Oh um...I hadn't asked yet. It's still three months away. When...uh...when do you need to know?"

Holly turns back to the stovetop to finish cooking the meal, but also to hide the start of her tears. She does her best to keep her voice from cracking. It comes out sounding a bit too cheerful, "Oh, it doesn't really matter, I guess. I'm going to go either way, so if you come, it's just one more person. Just let me know whenever you can."

Houston clears his throat and takes a sip of wine. He then changes back to their safe subject, "So, Anna Edwards seems to be adding to her cast of characters."

Holly doesn't turn, but does offer an encouragement to continue, "Yeah?"

"Yeah. She called both me and Travis Mr. Elton today, and she was talking about someone named Harriet. And she won't drop that accent. Maybe I should consult with someone from England."

Holly lets out a little laugh, "I think I can help you with that."

"Oh please do. How?"

"Well, I can't be sure, but Miss Taylor, Mr. Elton and Harriet are all from Emma."

Houston looks at her quizzically. Emma, like from my dream? How could she know that?

Holly continues, "It's a novel by Jane Austen."

Houston's face lights up a bit, "A book? There's a book about my patient. I knew it. I knew the answer would be in a book. This is great. I'll look for it tomorrow. Thanks, Holly." He goes over to her side of the bar and kisses her. Holly is finally starting to enjoy the evening, when Houston suddenly pulls away. He goes back to his stool and gives her a half smile. Holly turns back to the stove.
