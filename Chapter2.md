Houston walks down a long hallway toward his office. He carries a messenger bag, packed full, as well as a tower of 10 or so books. The top book is opened and Houston is reading intently, only looking up occasionally. He reaches an office door with a plaque that once said Dr. Ira Shenkman. The edges and some of the letters on either
end of the name are gone. Houston moves all of the books into his left arm. With his right, he reaches up to the mutilated name plaque on the door. He starts to pick at the plaque. As he breaks off a piece, he drops his load of books.

Houston sighs and crouches down to start picking up the books. After a moment he raises his head and sees George, crouching mere inches away from Houston's face - staring intently at him. George is middle-aged, a bit paunchy and naked. Houston drops the books again. "Shit!"

George jumps back.

"So George," Houston begins," uh...no robe today?"

"It's Wednesday, Doc. I'm Lady Godiva on Wednesdays. You know that."

Houston bends down to retrieve one of his fallen books. George is still standing, and rather closely, so Houston uses one hand as a blinder while he finds the right book with the other one. He stands and begins to flip through the pages. He does not look up from the book as he speaks. "It's funny you say that George." As he is speaking to George, Dr. Clinton Ashford, Houston's boss, comes down the hallway and watches the interaction between doctor and patient. "I was reading just last night about our tendency to apply a false significance to days simply because of their place on the calendar. And I really think that we could --"

George puts his hand over the book. "Please, Doc. Not on a Wednesday." He heads off in the direction opposite that of Dr. Ashford. Houston picks up his books once again and has opened his door a few inches when Ashford speaks. Ashford is a tall man, with a deep voice.

"You should step out of your books once in a while and walk a bit in his shoes."

Houston looks at Ashford, an amused look on his face.

"Figuratively, of course."

Houston forces a pleasant expression, "Dr. Ashford. What can I do for you?"

"Why don't we step into your office?"

Houston opens the door to his office and Ashford follows him in. There is a desk with chair and two chairs facing it. There is also a couch, but unsurprisingly, it is piled with books. Houston places his stuff on top of the couch. He then steps behind his desk. He opens the top drawer of his desk and drops in the piece of plaque. It joins several other pieces.

"Mitch," Ashford begins, "I'm going to add a patient to your schedule. She's on antipsychotics to treat schizophrenia but her sister says that she's been suffering from blind spells. She wants her medication changed and I'd like her supervised for it."

Houston looks a bit confused. "A medication change? She hardly needs a therapist for that." He walks over to the couch and picks up a book that he starts reading from. "Blurred vision is a common side effect of anti-psychotics."

Ashford claps Houston on the shoulder. Houston looks up from his book. "Come with me. She's in the rec room."

Houston and Ashford step into the recreation room. It is a fairly large room, divided, by furniture, into three parts. Furthest from the door they entered is a circle of ten or so arm chairs. In the middle, there are five round tables, each with four chairs. There are board games on two of the tables. At the near end are three couches and a large CRT television. The television is duct-taped to the tv stand which is chained to the wall. Also at this end is a nurses' station staffed by three or four. The nurses' station is open to both the rec room and the hallway. There are a several patients and one staff member watching HGTV. One of the patients is Matthew. He is in his midtwenties and quite handsome, but his face is covered in scratches and bruises. While he watches tv, he continuously tosses a tennis ball into the air. Another patient is George, who has a couch to himself. He is still naked. Two patients play Scrabble at one of the tables. Another table has three patients at it eating pudding.

Sitting alone in the circle of chairs with her knees pulled up to her chest and her head resting on her chin is Anna Edwards. She occasionally rocks back and forth and swats at the air as if under attack from bugs. As Houston and Ashford walk through the door, many of the patients briefly look in their direction.

Ashford addresses George. "George, I thought you understood that you weren't to come into the recreation room without your robe?"

"I know, Doctor Ashford. I've got it." George smiles and pulls at his robe which is tucked between him and the couch.

"I meant that you should be wearing it."

George begins to protest, but Ashford cuts him off quickly, "Even on Wednesdays, George. If you can't wear the robe, then you may stay in your room."

George pouts for a second and then pulls the robe around his bottom half neglecting the sleeves. He looks at Ashford questioningly. Ashford frowns but gives a slight nod of assent. George smiles and turns his attention back to the television.

Houston and Ashford continue their walk to the other end of the room. They stand a few feet away from Anna. Ashford gestures to her. "This is Anna."

When she hears her name, she looks up but not at the men. Her hair is unbrushed and unwashed. She is wearing standardissue gray pajamas and no-skid socks. Despite her ragged appearance, she is clearly the same woman Houston saw in his dream. "Emma?"

Ashford corrects him, "Anna."

Houston shakes his head as if to clear it. "Of course, Anna. It's nice to meet you."

He puts his hand out. Anna puts her hand out but misses his by about 6 inches. Houston waves his hands in front of Anna. She does not flinch. Houston takes her hand and she looks in his general direction. She appears to be looking through him rather than at him.

Anna speaks finally, in what seems to be an English accent, "The new gardener? James recommends you." Suddenly, Anna takes back her hand and pounds her fist to her forehead. She begins speaking again, but in an American accent. "No, no, no. There's no garden," laughing bitterly, "There's no garden in the land of the lost!"

Anna looks at the floor while she speaks. Houston leans down a bit to be on eye-level with Anna. "Anna, I'm Doctor Houston."

"Of course. The doctor. Isabella is forever calling the doctor for me."

Houston stands and looks to Ashford. "Isabella is her sister?"

Ashford shakes his head no then turns to Anna.

"Anna, who is Isabella?"

Returning to the English accent, "Only my sister, of course. If she knew she'd left me with a physician who couldn't even remember her name..."

"Anna," Ashford gently corrects, "Your sister's name is Laura."

Anna looks at him and tears fill her eyes. She then looks to Houston and her demeanor changes. She sits up very straight, puts her feet on the floor with her ankles crossed and folds her hands in her lap. Houston watches her as she does this and for an instant, he sees her as he did in the dream the night before. She is dressed as Emma but still sits on a chair in the rec room.

"Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know-- in a joke--it is all a joke," Anna responds while not really responding, "We always say what we like to one another."

Houston shakes his head and sees her once again in her gray pajamas. She curls up on the chair again and stares straight ahead.

Ashford lets Houston know that he'll have the full file brought to him, "Perhaps a more precise diagnosis will point us toward the right medication. She's only here for a couple of days, so it's important to get started right away."

"Yes, of course. So, when did she stop the medication?"

"We'll stop it tonight."

"I thought you said she was experiencing blindness from the medication. That's not blindness. That's a delusion or a fugue or something."

Ashford chuckles, "I never said blindness. That's what her sister called it. Once in a while, I know what I'm doing, Mitch."

Houston clears his throat, "No sir. I didn't mean...I--"

"It's fine, Mitch. Don't worry about my feelings. Focus on Anna."

Houston looks back at Anna with a puzzled look and then turns to walk out with Ashford.
