The next day, Houston paces his office, reading Emma. The office door is already open and an orderly enters with Anna, leads her to a seat and leaves.

Houston puts the book on his desk and speaks to Anna, "Anna, I hear that you were eating dinner with some of the other residents yesterday. I'm pleased that you're trying to interact with others."

Anna sits up straight, and with the English accent that Houston has become accustomed to says, "No, sir, it confesses no such thing. So far from having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings — Nothing could be farther from my wishes — your attachment to my friend Harriet — your pursuit of her – pursuit, it appeared – gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success:"

Houston grabs the novel and begins frantically flipping through it while Anna speaks, "I know this part…"

Anna continues, "But had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield, I  should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?—that you have never thought seriously of her?"

Anna pauses and Houston realizes that it is his turn to speak. He clears his throat and begins saying the lines of Mr. Elton but in his own American accent, "Never, madam, never, I assure you. I think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object to—Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!—" He looks up at Anna who seems unmoved. He tries again, this time trying to imitate her accent, "No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the Encouragement I received—"

Anna whips her head around and stares directly at Houston. It is the first eye contact she has made with anyone since her arrival. "Encouragement! — I give you encouragement! — Sir, you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend." Anna tries to control her speech, but she cannot help but get louder as she continues. 

Houston stares at her wide eyed. She continues, "In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of."

Dr. Ashford is passing by the office at this time and stops to listen to Anna's session. Anna continues her speech, "But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present."

"Oh, um…" Houston, who has been staring into Anna's eyes during her speech, looks back at the book, but sees there is no more dialogue. He puts the book down and attempts to speak to her off-script. "Anna. Anna? Emma is a nice diversion but I'd like to speak a little about you."

Anna looks at Houston for a brief moment and then looks back down and begins to wring her hands. "If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me--but poor Harriet!" Anna stands and paces while wringing her hands. 

Houston sighs and then looks up and sees Ashford standing in his doorway. He stands. "Doctor Ashford. How can I help you?"

Ashford steps into the office. Anna has not stopped speaking. In fact she has begun pacing the room during her speech, so the men move into the hallway and speak in low tones. "I just caught the last few minutes, Mitch. What exactly was I watching?"

Houston clears his throat and picks up the book again. "Well, sir, I've discovered that Anna's speeches are actual text from a novel. Since she went off the medication, she only speaks words from the novel, and I thought that maybe I could try finding her in her world rather than trying to drag her back into this one right away."

Ashford has been listening to Houston speak with a stone face. When Houston finishes speaking, Ashford smiles and chuckles. "Well, you didn't find a treatment like that in a book, did you?"

Houston raises the novel as if to disagree, but realizes this is not the type of book he means. "No sir. I--I couldn't find anything like Miss Edwards' case in any of my texts, and I just thought that–"

Ashford stops him with a clap to the shoulder. He is still looking amused. Anna has stopped speaking but continues to pace.

Ashford tries to reassure Houston, "Relax. I'm not sure it will work, but I don't see any harm in it. Just be careful you don't get sucked in yourself."

Both men laugh, but Houston's fades quickly, "No sir."

Anna sits on the chair again and speaks, "I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;—William Coxe—Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe—a pert young lawyer."

Ashford and Houston look at each other. Ashford raises his eyebrows and Houston merely shrugs.
