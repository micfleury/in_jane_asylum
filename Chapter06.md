The next day, Houston finds himself scanning the bookshelves in the hospital's sparse library (essentially a room with 5 rows of bookcases). He's not alone. Tim, a short, bald man with a thick mustache, mimics every move Houston makes -- taking down every book he looks at, touching every cover he touches and striking every pose he strikes. Dr. Houston looks over at him. Tim looks over as if there were someone next to him. Houston sighs. Tim follows suit.

Houston asks, "Are you looking for something?"

Tim asks back, "Are you looking for something?"

"I am."

"Me too," Tim confirms.

Houston tilts his head a bit, "I'm looking for the book, Emma."

"Same," says Tim.

Houston maintains eye contact a moment longer, trying to decide if there's any authenticity in Tim's response.

The doctor makes his way to the front where a librarian is sorting through a small pile of books. Tim is close on his heels. Houston greets the librarian and she asks how she can help. "Um... I'm looking for the book--"

Before he can finish his sentence, Tim speaks over him, "Emma! I'm looking for the book, Emma."

Houston nods, "Yes, that's what I'm looking for."

The librarian speaks to Houston, ignoring Tim. "Oh, I love that one. I love Jane Austen." She looks off into the distance and licks her lips for a moment. The librarian nods and smiles at Houston. After a long moment, she turns back to Houston, nodding and smiling.

Houston smiles back and then prompts, "Could you help me find it then?"

"Oh yeah. Of course, of course." She walks over to a bookshelf and starts reading the spines of the books, "Austen, Austen, Austen. Oh...Isaac Asimov." The librarian pulls a book off the shelf and holds it out. "Have you read any Asimov? He's a genius. The stuff that comes out of his head. He's just delicious. You're not going to find better."

"But I'm looking for Emma."

"Right. Emma." She thumbs through a few more titles and pulls out the right one. "Here it is. Such a great story. Funny, romantic. Oh, she's just yummy."

She hands the book to Houston who pages through the book only to discover that the last 100 pages or so are missing. "Where's the end of the book? It's missing a bunch of pages."

"Sorry?" The librarian blinks widely at him.

Houston opens the book to show her, "This isn't the whole book."

Just then, Travis walks in. "Julie, there you are. Dr. Francis is looking for you for your appointment."

Julie looks at Houston, giggles and shrugs. As Travis is leading her out of the room, she grabs a paperback book off the nearest shelf. "For the road," she says as she takes a bite of the book.

In what has essentially become his default post, Houston covers puts his head in his hand and takes a deep breath. Then, he takes his half-book and makes his way toward the exit. He hears Tim behind him. "Asimov. Delicious."

—----------------------------------------------------

By the end of the day, Houston has read the available pages of the book. Some of the quotes from the book sound a lot like Anna and he starts to formulate an idea. He texts Holly to ask if he can come over. She quickly answers and he heads to his car for the drive to her house.

When she opens the door, he immediately launches into his plan to speak lines from the book to Anna to try to get a response. He pulls the book out of his bag and heads to the couch with Holly. She curls up next to him and plays with his hair, trying to distract him from his book, but he simply starts reading aloud.

"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her..."

He looks up at Holly suspiciously, "I can't believe that you read this. Who would read this?"

Holly laughs, "I didn't. I saw the movie. With Gwyneth Paltrow?"

He shifts away a bit and drops the book in her lap, "So, maybe I should see the movie?"

Holly shrugs, "Well you could, but you've got the script right here."

"Right..." Houston pushes further back so that he's sitting in the corner of the couch opposite Holly.

Holly flips through the book and notices the missing pages, "Mitch, there's something wrong with this book."

"I know. A patient ate some of the pages."

"Well, don't you think maybe you should get a full copy?"

"I don't think it matters. If this doesn't work, I'll know soon enough. I can always get a new copy in the future if necessary."

Houston reaches for the book and Holly tosses it to him. He holds it but doesn't open it. "Should I even be doing this? It goes against everything I know...participating in a patient's delusion."

"Mitch, you're the doctor, but since you asked...I think yeah. Get into her head a  bit."

Houston smiles mischievously and puts his nose in the book again. Without looking up, he asks, "What would I do without you?"

Holly picks up a magazine off the coffee table and leans back on the couch. She sighs as she begins to thumb through it.

—---------------------------

Houston wakes on Holly's couch with the book still in his hand and an afghan over him. He sits up on the couch. He sees Holly in the kitchen, making coffee. He lifts a hand in greeting, "Oh, hey. Good morning."

Houston grabs his briefcase and walks into the kitchen with it and with the book that is now flagged with nearly a hundred sticky notes. He puts the briefcase and book down on the island. 

Holly hands him a cup of coffee. Not bothering to hide her annoyance since Mitch never seemed to notice it anyway, she coolly asks, "So, how was the book?"

"I don't remember anything that I read last night, but I got through the whole thing and marked it." He holds it up to show her and then puts it in his briefcase. "Now, I just have to figure out how I'm going to keep up with her. Maybe I should have—"

Holly holds up her hand which stops Houston speaking. "Mitch. My shift doesn't start for–" She checks her watch, "An hour and...twelve minutes. I don't want to talk about work."

Houston puts down his coffee mug, a bit surprised by Holly's hostility. "Sure, I'm sorry. I was just excited about making some progress. For Doctor Ashford to give me this opportunity, especially after two of my patients–" Houston realizes that Holly is glaring at him while he continues to talk about work. He clears his throat and changes the subject. "So, should we go out for dinner tonight?"

Holly shakes her head, "No. In fact, I don't think we should go out at all anymore." 

"What? Why?"

"Mitch, you're a dedicated doctor. You work day and night trying to find the answer to your patients' problems. But–" Holly moves her hands to indicate give and take. "--you're not any good at this. And I deserve to be with someone who will put as much effort into a relationship as he puts into his job."

Holly picks up her backpack off the ground and then walks around the island to Houston. She kisses him softly on the cheek and heads for the door. "Leave the key in my mailbox at work, okay?" She walks out the back door. 

Houston looks up as the door closes. He sighs and then turns back to his briefcase and takes out the book and starts thumbing through it.
