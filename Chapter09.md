Their time is not yet up, so no orderly has arrived for Anna. Dr. Houston walks her back to the rec room himself. He walks her over to the nurses' desk and taps the countertop twice. "Hi. Just bringing Anna Edwards back."

One of the nurses looks up and vaguely points toward the couches near the station. Houston walks Anna over to one and she sits. He walks back past the station and calls out, "Good night!" Anna looks up from her hands and right at Houston.

"Good night."

Houston makes to speak to her, but decides not to press his luck. He simply smiles and gives a small wave. He then leaves as Anna watches him.

He hurries back to his office and opens the book. He has never picked up the full book, but continues to read from the one he got at the library. He opens to a random page and begins reading aloud. "You have given Miss Smith all that she required. You have made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature."

Houston looks around the room, but it is still just his office. He flips to a new page and tries again. "I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.—It was the work of a moment."

Houston looks up again, but there is nothing to see. "And--And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable—indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again—yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made discoveries." Still nothing! In frustration, Houston throws the book onto the desk.

"How the hell did she do that?"

Houston heads for Dr. Ashford's office. The doctor is alone, so Houston sits in a chair opposite him. "I need more time with Anna. I can bring her out of this. I know I can. We just need to delay her new medication."

"Mitchell, Anna started her new meds last night," Ashford tells him. "I appreciate the efforts you put in, but I'm sure we'll see marked improvement in the next twenty four hours. I don't see any reason to stop the medication again."

"Dr. Ashford, how can you act like she's any other patient? We're not just talking about someone with an active imagination. She is so deep into this. She is Emma. She speaks her words. She lives in her world. When she looks around a room, she sees an old English manor and characters from the novel."

"Then you've gotten her to deviate
from the novel?" Ashford asks hopefully. "She described her surroundings to you?"

Houston opens his mouth to speak, pauses, starts again. "No, not exactly."

"So, what exactly? You're just assuming that she sees what Emma sees?"

"No, sir. I know what she's seeing. I can't really explain how, but–"

Ashford holds up his hand, "Mitch, please stop. I know that I told you to try a new approach, but I don't think that encouraging this woman's delusion is the way to go. I know that Anna is a beautiful woman, and her English maiden act can be quite charming–"

Houston is offended and does not hide it. "Dr. Ashford, I don't want to do this because she's charming. I want to do this because we are at a critical point. She looked at me earlier. Right at me. I'm sure she saw reality if only for that moment." Houston takes a breath. "I think that medication is the wrong approach."

Ashford considers before answering, "No. We will keep Miss Edwards an extra few days, but she will continue the medication along with her therapy."

Houston sighs and stands up, "It's something."

Ashford admonishes, "But, you will not neglect any of your sessions with the other patients."

Houston begins to nod in agreement.

"And you will have to come in on the weekends. Consistency is paramount with our patients. If you're going to insist on these sessions, then they must be daily."

"Absolutely, sir. Not a problem."

Ashford scoffs, "I imagine Nurse Williams would disagree."

"Oh...I didn't know you knew about that," Mitch replies. "Well, nothing to know anymore. We're over."

"I'm sorry to hear that. I trust our working environment isn't going to suffer?"

"Of course not, sir. It was all very amiable." Houston turns toward the door.

Ashford's next comment stops him, "Ironic, isn't it?"

"What's that, sir?" Houston asks, turning back.

"You finally took your nose out of your textbooks and ended up in a novel instead."

Houston smiles nervously and leaves the office.

The next day, Houston is wrapping up the group therapy session. Many in the group are clapping. Anna continues to be unaware of her surroundings. Jacob is rolling his eyes and twitching his leg. George, the apparent object of adoration, is strutting around in the center of the circle, in a three-piece suit.

"George, how does it feel?" Houston asks.

George pulls at his collar and tie. "It sure is a lot of fabric."

Several people laugh.

"Well, I was expecting you to start small...maybe some pants under your robe. But, you seem to be doing okay," Houston encourages.

George continues to pull at the tie until it is undone and simply hanging around his neck. "How do you all do it?"

People laugh again, this time more quietly.

"One leg at a time. Now, how about we let these people go and get over to the visitors' room? You must be anxious...I mean, excited...to see your family." Houston puts his arm about George's shoulders and walks him toward Travis, who is waiting at the door. The rest of the group files out behind George, except for Anna.

Houston walks over to her, "Anna, we're going to have our session early today. Come with me."

Anna doesn't look at him, but offers no protest and leaves the room with Houston.

Houston and Anna sit facing each other. Houston has his book with him. He doesn't open it though. "Anna. I was very encouraged last night when you said good night."

Anna immediately responds with a quote from the book, "I am happy you approved, but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."
 
Houston sighs and starts turning the pages. "Okay. Let's get started then." He quickly locates the right page in the book. "No, you are not often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension."

Houston's accent is slowly becoming that of a proper Englishman. "I think you understand me, therefore."

"Miss Fairfax is reserved," Anna says.

"I always told you she was--a little;" Houston has heard himself and tries clearing his throat, but when he speaks, he still has the English accent. "but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured."

Houston looks up from the book and finds himself in a different room than when he first experienced Anna's delusion. Anna's appearance has changed as it did before. Houston is also dressed differently and his hairstyle has changed, but he has no way of knowing that.

"You think her diffident. I do not see it."

Houston looks down to the book and it is instead a sheaf of papers, but he is able to read his part from it nonetheless. He now sees that his own outfit has changed from an oxford shirt and khakis to something more 18th century. "My dear Emma, you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening."

"Oh! No; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused to think how little information I obtained."

Houston knows his next line without looking down. Perhaps he has memorized it after so much study, "I am disappointed."

Another voice calls out, "I hope every body had a pleasant evening."

Houston looks toward the voice and is shocked to see an older gentleman sitting near the fireplace. It is Mr. Woodhouse.

"I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me." Mr. Woodhouse continues.

Houston is completely shocked to hear the old man speaking. He looks to Anna as if to say, "Do you see that?" Anna simply smiles at him.

"Miss Bates was very chatty and goodhumoured, as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick." Mr. Woodhouse looks to his daughter for agreement and she gives him a slight nod. "However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way."

Houston shrugs and sits back in his chair, listening to Mr. Woodhouse.

"I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening agreeable, Dr. Houston, because she had Emma."

Houston shakes his head, unsure if he heard correctly when Mr. Woodhouse called him Dr. Houston. He speaks his line anyway. "True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax."

Mr. Woodhouse speaks again; his mouth moves but neither the words nor the voice are his. "What? What did you say Dr. Houston?"

Houston looks over to Anna who is smirking a little. He then looks back to Mr. Woodhouse, but instead he sees his office again and Travis standing in the doorway. Houston looks back to Anna who still sits in the sitting room in Hartfield. She is laughing now and biting her lip not to. She lifts her hand and waggles her finger as if to say goodbye.

Houston looks down at himself and sees that he is back in his own clothes. He stands up and turns to Travis. He is still speaking with an English accent. "Travis...um...how can I assist–" Houston clears his throat and speaks again in his normal accent. "What can I do for you?"

Travis gives him a look, "Are you okay, Doc? You were talking kinda funny."

"Oh sure. Just fine. So, what's up?"

"I'm here to pick up Anna. It's lunch time."

Houston looks over to Anna who is now back to her institutional self--drab robe and unkempt hair. "Alright then. Thanks, Travis. Anna, I'll see you tomorrow." Houston goes to his desk. He opens a file and dials a number on the phone.

"Mrs. Barrett? This is Mitchell Houston, Anna's doctor. Do you think we could meet?"
