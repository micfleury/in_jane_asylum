Houston sits on the couch, his hand on Laura Barrett's shoulder. Laura is leaning forward with her head in her hands. Ashford is pacing. He stops in front of the couch. "Mrs. Barrett, I hope you believe me when I tell you that Anna's recovery is of utmost importance to all of us here at Clover Ridge."

Laura sits up straight and wipes at tears, "I don't understand. Can't we just put her back on the old medication? The kids and I can help her."

"Yes, of course we can. But, Laura," Houston speaks softly, "The medication won't bring Anna back. There is no quick fix."

Ashford adds, "Anna requires long-term care at this point. We have been unable to break her delusion in several days. I feel that we will find the proper combination of medication and therapy to bring her back around."

"Long-term? What is long-term? I need an endpoint. I can't do this and raise a family."

Houston nods in agreement, "We understand. At this point, there is no knowing when Anna will have another episode of clarity. Maybe you can save your visits for when we've seen some progress."

Laura stands. Houston hastily stands as well.

"I think that might be best. I should go see her before I leave."

Ashford gestures toward the office door, "Of course. I'll take you to her."

Houston makes to follow them. Ashford looks at him sternly. Houston calls after Laura, "Laura, I'll speak to you soon."

Laura nods and leaves the office followed by Ashford.

—--------------------------------

Anna sits on her bed staring out the window. She is not speaking lines as she usually does and her posture is more slouched than usual. Laura and Ashford enter the room. Anna turns when she hears them but does not change her expression. Laura walks over to her.

"Anna, this is going to be my last visit for a while. Dr. Ashford is going to take care of you and you'll be coming home in no time," Laura wraps her arms around Anna who doesn't reciprocate. Instead, she sits up straighter and looks at Laura.

"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return?"

Laura begins to cry, "I'll miss you too. Take care of yourself."

Anna stands from her bed and walks over to stare out the window. She doesn't speak again.

Ashford turns to Laura, "Mrs. Barrett, I am personally going to do whatever I can to help Anna."

Laura nods and Ashford leaves the room. Laura then walks over to Anna and brushes her fingers through her hair. She kisses her temple. She then turns to follow Ashford.

Laura has returned to Houston's office and sits in a chair facing him, "Dr. Ashford told me about you and my sister."

"Laura, I don't know what he told you, but I assure you, I have always had Anna's best interests at heart."

"He told me that you've been playing a knight or something from her novel."

Houston chuckles at that, "Mr. Knightley, actually. It seemed that when I played the part, she couldn't ignore me. I got through to her. I can do it again. She's had a bad couple of days, but I know that we can recover from it. I can find her again."

Laura stands up and holds out her hand. Houston stands as well and takes it.

"I believe you can, Dr. Houston." They shake hands and smile sadly at each other.

"If only I could convince Dr. Ashford of that."

—--------------------------------------
Houston sits in a circle with his group. The mood is entirely different from that of previous sessions; the empty chair telling the story. Houston looks at his patients - every expression is sullen, depressed, sorrowful.

"Does anyone have anything they want to say? Anything they want to ask?"

There are no responses.

"George?"

George looks away.

"Jack?"

Jack doesn't respond either.

"Okay. Well, I'll tell you what I can. After everyone left Matthew's celebration, Anna and I were speaking privately. Dr. Ashford saw us and decided that Anna's is not progressing as he'd hoped. She's been assigned to a new doctor and a new group."

"But, where is she?" Jack asks.

Houston tells them that Anna's been spending time alone in her room.

"Anna is sick," says Susan.

George replies, "We're all sick."

"She tried to kill me," Susan says, nodding furiously.

A few of the patients gasp.

"She did not try to kill anyone, Susan."

"It was love," Susan continues. "It is love that gets us all, Francois."

Houston is caught off guard. He looks questioningly at Susan.

"What will you do, Francois? Will you stand by and let them separate you?"

Houston is speechless. He looks confused and keeps opening and closing his mouth in fits and starts.

"Dr. Houston?" Jack asks. He looks around at the rest of the group, "Is he okay?"

—------------------------------------

Houston lies in bed, restless. He picks up Emma off the floor and looks at it, without bothering to turn on the light. He fingers the eaten pages and speaks to the empty room, "How does it end?" He holds it in his hands for a moment, staring at the back cover. Finally, he drops it back on the floor and closes his eyes.
