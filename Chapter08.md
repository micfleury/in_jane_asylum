After some success acting out the novel with Anna, Houston decides to try again with a group therapy session. He walks over to the circle of chairs and takes his seat. Several patients sit with Dr. Houston. Amongst them are Anna, Jack, Susan, Janice, Matthew, and George wearing a robe and a winter hat. Also there is Jacob Miller, an attractive young man who is there by court order. He looks around the room, bored and disgusted. Anna sits beside Jacob.

Houston greets the group, "Hello everyone. Glad to see you today. We have two new members to our group. Anna, Jacob, perhaps you'd like to introduce yourselves?"

The room is silent. Anna mimes as if she is drinking tea from a delicate china cup. Jacob simply slouches down a bit in his chair and rolls his eyes.

Houston clears his throat, "Okay. Perhaps next time. Does anyone have anything they'd
like to share with Anna or Jacob about our group here?"

George states that he does and stands up and starts to undo his robe. Houston quickly vetoes, "No, George." 

Houston watches Anna lean over and whisper something to Jacob. Jacob looks at her scornfully, "Whatever."

Anna again whispers in Jacob's ear. Jacob laughs but without humor, "Freak."

Jacob catches Dr. Houston staring at them and quickly looks down. Anna continues talking while Jacob just shakes his head. Jacob moves his chair a few inches away from  Anna. Houston continues the session. At the end, while the patients slowly file out of the room, Houston sees Jacob closely followed by Anna. He stops him, "Jacob? Can I speak with you a moment?"

Jacob looks back at Anna, who seems plenty happy and in her own world. She passes by and exits the room, leaving Jacob and Houston alone.

Jacob is on the defensive immediately, "What?"

"It's nothing really. I just wanted to ask you a quick question."

Jacob shrugs, "Go ahead."

"I'm wondering what you and Anna were whispering about today?"

Jacob shrugs again, "I don't know. Nothing. She was talking about letter from Winston Churchill or something."

"Frank Churchill?"

"Yeah, maybe."

Houston writes something in his notebook, "Did she say anything else?"

"No. Look...can I go?"

"Yeah, of course, yeah. Thanks for talking with me."

"No problem," Jacob is about to leave, but then stops to ask, "So, what's her deal?"

"I'm not really at liberty to discuss. All I can say is that she's a mystery."

"Cool."

"Not really." Jacob snorts at that. Houston continues, "But, thank you. I appreciate you hanging back."

—---------------------------

Houston sits at his desk, thumbing through Emma again. There is a double knock at the door. Travis opens the door and stands there with Anna. Houston puts the book down and looks up. "Hi Travis, Anna. Travis, isn't Dr. Ashford sitting in on the session today?"

Travis walks Anna over to the chair and gets her to sit down, "I'm not actually in charge of his calendar, Doc, but I don't think so. I saw him headed to his car just a few minutes ago."

"Huh...got a better offer, I guess."

Anna seems to contradict him, "I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him."

Travis looks confused, but since Anna has said this with an English accent, Houston picks up the book with excitement. Travis clears his throat and Houston looks up, "Thanks, Travis. You can go. We're all set."

Travis leaves and Houston starts thumbing through the book again. Anna, not one to wait for a reply, continues with her end of the conversation. "How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?"

Houston has found the page and holds the book up in triumph. He quickly recovers, though, and starts to read in his very un-Austen-like American accent, "I...um...I-I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connections, and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too."

Houston looks up from the text for Anna's response. However, instead of seeing Anna sitting in the chair in his office, he sees her sitting near a fireplace on a small sofa that he has never seen before. She is in a room straight out of Austen's era. Anna is no longer in her standard issue pajamas and robe, but in a pretty gown. Her hair doesn't hang in a knotted mess but is all pulled up but for some soft curls around her face. Houston calls out to her, forgetting to use his next line from the book, "Anna?"

Anna turns her head toward Houston and looks at him with wide eyes and shock. What she sees is not her friend Mr. Knightley, but Houston sitting on the chair in his office.

"Anna? Can you see me?" He looks down at himself and looks back up to see Anna in the odd setting. There isn't a clear line dividing them; somehow the two rooms are melded together. Anna continues to stare at him. Her eyes fill with tears.

He answers his own question, "You can see me." Houston makes to reach out to her but then pulls his hand back. "Anna, please speak to me. This is a safe environment. I can help you deal with what's happening."

Suddenly a look of determination settles on Anna's face. She slowly shakes her head no. Houston sees Anna change right before his eyes and then sees the room turn back into his office. Houston quickly finds his place in the book and begins to read again. "Okay, okay, okay. Uh...If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it between September and January. A man at his age—what is he?—three or fourand-twenty—cannot be without the means of doing as much as that. It is impossible."

Houston looks up again, but the scene remains unchanged. The moment has passed. Anna speaks her "lines" nonetheless. "That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage."

Houston puts the book aside and tries to speak to Anna again. "Hear me, Anna. It's not easy for anyone to lose their parents, but you still have your sister and your nephews. Anna...I know you can come out of this if you want to. You have to want to. Emma isn't real. What will you do when you reach the end of the book?"

Anna says nothing. Not even another part from the book. Houston sighs and speaks. "We're going to start the new medication tomorrow morning. I wish we could have made some progress without it, don't you?"

Anna's eyes well up again, and a single tear falls, "Yes--."

Houston looks hopeful and starts to smile, but then Anna continues and he realizes she is merely speaking her next line.

"--sometimes he can."

Houston puts the book down and sighs.
