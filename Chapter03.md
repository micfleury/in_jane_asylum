Houston is working in his office when he hears a knock. Holly, one of the hospital's nurses, opens the door. "Doctor Houston?" Houston looks up at Holly, a moderately
attractive woman of about thirty. She is dressed in butterfly print scrubs and has her curly brown hair tied back neatly. She is carrying a some folders.

Houston clears his throat, "Holly, I'm sorry I didn't call. I had a lot of work and I just didn't notice the time until--"

Holly puts up a hand and breaks in, "It's fine. I was just bringing you the overnight reports." She hands the pile of papers to Houston. "But, since you're feeling guilty, I'll let you make it up to me at lunch."

"Yeah definitely," he clears his throat again, "I just...um...I have a new patient today. Let's do it tomorrow?"

Holly narrows her eyes a bit but then smiles. "Tomorrow then. It's a date." Houston smiles slightly and nods his head. She leaves to head back to the nurses' station.

Still nodding, Houston begins reviewing the reports, seeming to be looking for something. He flips through them several times before he picks up the phone and calls Holly. "Holly? It's Mitch. I seem to be missing a report. Paul Robbins." As he's listening to Holly's response, he becomes angry and starts to stand up from his desk, grabbing the pile. He signs off quickly, "I see. No, of course. Not going to kill the messenger. Talk to you later."

Houston walks into Ashford's office suite. He makes to walk right past the desk of Ashford's assistant Rachael. However, one look from her changes his mind and he stops beside her desk. "Hi Rachael. Is he in?"

Rachael lets him know that Dr. Ashford's on a phone call.

Houston sighs, "Can you interrupt him? It's important."

Rachael indicates the reports Houston is holding. "Is this regarding Harris and Robbins?"

Houston's face falls even further, "Harris, too?" Houston begins thumbing through the reports again. "Two of my patients transfer to another doctor and I have to hear it from a nurse? I was with Ashford for half an hour this morning. Does he treat all of the staff like this? Nineteen months and my door still says 'Shenkman' for crying out loud." He catches himself and takes a breath. Certainly his boss's assistant is not the object of his ire. He takes a breath and apologizes, "Sorry. I should be discussing this with Doctor Ashford."

Rachael leans forward a bit and speaks softly in contrast to Houston's loud complaint. "Doctor Houston, I have been here thirty years. I may not have any letters after my name, but I've picked up a thing or two. In therapy, as in life, sometimes people just don't click. Paul asked to be transferred to a doctor who would show a little
more empathy for his situation.  Doctor Emile focuses less on published methods. He likes to create individual treatments."

Houston is about to protest, but Rachael holds up a hand. Houston drops the reports in one of the chairs facing Rachael's desk and sits in the other.

"That's not to say there's anything wrong with your method, Doctor Houston. As I said, sometimes people just don't click. You're doing a wonderful job with many of your patients. George adores you. Says you're the best therapist he's had."

Houston snorts, "George's been here two years and still can't wear clothing for more than five minutes at a time. What has my method done for him?" He sighs and picks up the reports. He rises to walk out of the office. turning back to Rachael, "Please don't tell him I was here."

Rachael nods and smiles gently. "It's our secret. Oh, and Mitch? Anna Edwards' file."

Houston takes the file and adds it to the pile and then heads back to his office.

Houston rests his face in his hands, completely burnt out and exhausted. There's a knock at his door. Travis, an orderly, enters with Anna Edwards and leads her to a chair. He nods to Houston and leaves. Houston makes to speak, but is interrupted by Anna, who speaks with an impeccable English accent. "Well, you want to know about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you--"

Houston breaks in, "Anna. I don't know about any wedding. We met earlier today, remember?"

Anna continues as if there were no interruption at all, "--for we all behaved charmingly. Everybody was punctual, everybody in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh, no; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day."

Anna pauses, so Houston clears his throat and starts to read notes from Anna's chart aloud, "According to your chart, you were first diagnosed with schizophrenia in college. Your roommate complained that you were in constant conversation with a Miss Taylor."

Anna replies, "Ah, but she is dear Miss Taylor no more. She is now dear Mrs. Weston." Anna laughs bitterly and then pounds at her head. She begins to speak again, but this time with an American accent. "No, no, no. She's not Mrs. Weston. Imaginary. Imaginary friends."

Houston looks at her curiously, but then looks back at the chart and continues reading, "You were treated with therapy only until the death of your father, at which point your doctors thought that you might benefit from medication."

Anna who had been agitated just a moment before, sits up prim and proper once again. "And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me, and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing."

Houston rolls his eyes and then grabs one of his beloved text books. He speaks to Anna without looking up, "Before we start you on the new medications, we are going to give your system a couple days reprieve. So, you and I will meet daily while you're here. Hopefully being without your medication won't be too much of a hardship."

Anna continues "And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess? I pity you. I thought you cleverer; for depend upon it, a lucky guess is never merely luck."

Houston walks over to Anna and snaps his fingers in front of Anna's face. Anna does not react at all. Houston walks back to his desk and pushes a button on his
phone to summon Travis.

Anna has been speaking the whole time, "You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third, -- a something between the do-nothing and the do-all."

The door to the office opens and Travis enters. Houston tells him that Anna is ready to go. Travis walks over to Anna and directs her off the couch. Houston watches as Anna is escorted out of the room. "Anna. I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow."

Anna seems like she's going to respond, but she turns to Travis and continues in her strange speech, "If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that."

Travis shrugs at Houston and then walks her through the office door.
