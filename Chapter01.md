Mr. Woodhouse, a man who doesn't look terribly old but certainly feels terribly old, sits close to the fire, trying to warm his "ancient" bones. He looks up to see his younger child Emma, hardly a child at all at 20, delicately step toward him and choose a chair close to him, but not too close to the fire.

Immediately, he begins to lament, "Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"

Emma, though dearly missing her beloved governess, protests "I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own."

Mr. Woodhouse scoffs, "A house of her own!--but where is the advantage of a house of her own? This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my dear."

Emma makes to speak again and calm her father's nerves, when a servant enters the room to announce Mr. Knightley, a neighbor and friend of the Woodhouse family. Mr. Knightley is mid-thirties and if not handsome then certainly well put-together. He is greeted warmly and invited to sit. They all sit in front of the fire.

Mr. Woodhouse addresses his guest, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk."

Mr. Knightley, familiar with Mr. Woodhouse's worrying nature, hurries to put him at ease. "Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful, moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire." He moves his chair back a foot or so, bringing it about even with Emma's. "By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all behave? Who cried most?"

Mr. Woodhouse again laments, "Ah! Poor Miss Taylor. 'Tis a sad business."

Mr. Knightley is quick to disagree, "Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say 'poor Miss Taylor.' It must be better to have only one to please than two."

Emma assumes blame on herself which may or may not have been implied, "Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature! That is what you have in your head, I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."

Her father shakes his head, "I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed. I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."

Emma immediately protests and reaches for her father's hand, "My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean you. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know-- in a joke--it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another." Mr. Knightley smiles ruefully at Emma, not entirely agreeing with her statement. Emma continues, "Well, you want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved charmingly."

As Emma speaks, Knightley hears a buzzing making it difficult to hear her. He squints a bit at her but she doesn't notice and makes no break in her story, "Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day."

Knightley shakes his head but the noise persists. He looks over at Emma, whose lips are still moving, but he cannot hear her at all. He only hears the buzzing. As he presses his hand to his forehead and closes his eyes in hopes of blocking it out. When he opens his eyes again, everything is bathed in a red light. He turns toward its source and sees the numbers 6:30. Time to wake up. Time to leave that sitting room with the woman and her father and start the day. What had they called him? Mr. Knight? Strange.

Dr. Mitchell Houston had been having a variation of this dream for about a month, but this was the longest one and the first time anyone had addressed him by name. He sat up in his king-sized bed and looked at the dozen or so psychiatric texts scattered on it. Certainly not going to find something as frivolous as dream interpretation in any of them, but maybe there'd be something at the office. Houston sits up on the edge of the bed, scratches at his head with both hands and then stands and heads for the shower.
