About a week later, Houston walks over to the nurses' station and is greeted coolly by Holly, "Morning."

Houston smiles, "Good morning."

Holly hands him a chart, "Anna is back at her window."

Houston takes the chart but doesn't open it, "Anna isn't my patient anymore."

"Just thought you might want to take a look."

He opens the file, "Is she speaking at all?"

"Got me. Read the damn chart," Holly turns away.

Houston looks around the room. There is a dreariness to it now. The light-hearted, comical side has disappeared; it seems grayer almost, darker. He sighs.

Holly turns back, "You're an idiot, you know. You'd have to be. You're choosing a mentalcase over me."

"Holly, it's not like that. There's nothing between us."

"I'm a big girl, Mitch."

Houston sighs again, "Why does everyone see something but me?"

Holly chuckles and walks away.

Houston, once again, looks around the room. It simply isn't the same.

Houston heads for his office. Sitting down at his desk, he begins to thumb through a stack of papers when he hears a knock. He looks up to see Ashford entering.

"Got a minute?"

"Of course," Houston responds.

"I wanted to let you know that Anna is being transferred to another hospital."

Houston stares. Ashford continues, "I had her working with Dr. Lawlor and he just feels that Anna would be better off in a new environment."

Houston, quietly, "Well, I'm sure he knows best."

Ashford sighs in frustration at Houston, "You can't fix everyone, Mitchell. Therapy is often about finding the right fit. You weren't the right fit for Anna but--"

Houston interrupts, "Or Jack, or George...heck Janice did better on her own than with anything I taught her."

"Don't be so hard on yourself. If these people were healthy, they wouldn't be here. You work hard and you care. They know that. It's all anyone could ask for. It's all I ask for. I never asked you to save the world."

Houston snaps, "You asked me to save Anna Edwards!" His eyes are red-rimmed.

"I asked you to meet with her. And you did that. You're right, she's a special case. But, you're wrong about not being a fit for her. It seems that you were a perfect fit."

Houston rolls his eyes and snorts, "I am not in love with her."

"I didn't say that you were."

"Exactly," Houston says, "Knightley is in love with her. I am NOT Knightley."

"Alright then. Are you ready to get back to work?"

Houston nods, "I am working. I've got a pile of papers here."

Ashford puts his hand on top of the papers, "Get out in the rec room. Play some ping pong with George. Or paint with Jack. You can't hide in here." He lingers for only a moment and then exits.

Houston picks up his stapler and throws it across the room. Then, he sighs and stands up and walks toward his office door.

He's headed for the rec room, but take a sudden turn and finds himself at the door to Anna's room. Anna is staring out the window. He calls to her, "Anna? Anna, I've come to say goodbye."

She turns to him, and the scene is immediately transformed. Anna and Houston are standing in the parlor. There is another woman with them, Harriet. She stands near to Houston. Anna walks toward them.

Houston begins speaking words that aren't his own, "I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the 'love,' which nobody carries?"

Anna has tears forming in her eyes when she replies, "Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?"

"Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time."

They stare uneasily at each other. Their last meeting having been so unpleasant and neither knowing what to do next. 

Mr. Woodhouse enters, relieving them of any immediate decisions, "Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?—And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?—I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so attentive to them!"

Anna's eyes fill with tears and she shakes her head slightly, blushing. She looks up at Houston who looks back at her with an expression just short of a smile. They move to shake hands. Houston presses Anna's hand warmly and moves to kiss it, but perhaps sensing the watchful eyes of Harriet and Mr. Woodhouse or perhaps afraid of the connection, drops her hand instead.

"Goodbye," Houston nods to all the occupants of the room and hastily retreats.

As Houston steps away from Anna he steps back into her room at the hospital and then, with a shake of his head, out of it. Anna turns back to the window.
