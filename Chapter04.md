Houston paces naked around his living room, which has even more books than his
office, if that's possible. There is a couch and a small television. The tv is on, but muted; it casts the only light in the room. He moves right up to the tv, holding a book very close to his nose. He’s mumbling to himself, "Dr. Emile more empathetic than me?" he snorts, "I can feel what my patients feel."

Frustrated, he drops the book on the couch and turns on a light, while turning off the tv. He catches a glimpse of himself reflected in the tv, "And right now, I feel cold." He quickly pulls on some sweatpants. While he's doing that, the telephone rings. It rings only once and then goes to the answering machine. Houston stops and listens to the message. 

It's Holly, "Hi Mitch. It's me. I know we're meeting tomorrow for lunch, but if you wanted to...you know...get a drink or something...Anyway, call me."

Houston makes a move as if to pick up the phone, but opts to resume his pacing. He reaches for his beer on the floor in front of the couch. He takes a gulp which he swishes around in his mouth before swallowing.

—----------------------------------------------

The next morning, Houston arrives at work and stops at the nurse's station. He puts his pile of books on the counter, with the top book opened as usual. He speaks without looking up from the book, "Can I get the overnight reports for Houston?"

The nurse turns around and it is Holly. She smiles and waves a stack of papers under his nose, "Here you go. You know, you can just pull these up on the computer in your office."

Houston's head snaps up at the sound of her voice. He tries to recover and stammers a response"Well...uh...then I wouldn't have any excuse to stop and talk to you. Umm...so, later then."
 
He waves the reports at Holly as if to indicate that he needs to get busy reading them. He places the reports on top of his pile of books, picks it up and begins to navigate the obstacle course of people through a set of double doors.

Holly calls out, "Mitch? Did you get my–" but Houston has exited through the doors, "--message? See you at lunch I guess."

—------------------------------------------
Houston and Holly sit at a small table eating lunch. There is a medium-thick file on the table. Holly casually (at least she hopes it sounds casual) asks about the new patient that made Mitch miss lunch the day before. 

"Anna. She's been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Her sister says that she's been experiencing temporary blindness on her current medication. So, we're keeping her here during the switch. I don't think it's blindness though. It's not just that she doesn't see what's in front of her. She sees a whole scene that isn't. Also, sometimes she talks with an accent, like she's a character from Dickens or something. I can't find  anything in my books that encompasses all of that."

Holly laughs, "Not in a book? That must make you crazy." Houston winces at the word and Holly tries to look properly chastised. 

He continues, "I don't know if she's schizophrenic at all. She appears to be suffering
from fugues and possibly dissociative identity disorder." 

"And it all just started last year?"

"Yeah...when her father died. She was already in treatment for an imaginary friend she  had since her mother died," Houston pauses to take a bite of his sandwich, "But she didn't give Miss Taylor up as she got older."

Holly interrupts, "Miss Taylor?"

"The imaginary friend. Then when she was in college, her roommate mentioned it to their RA and that's when she started therapy."

Holly looks up at the wall clock and starts to gather up the remains of her lunch, "I don't remember a Miss Taylor from any Dickens I've read…I've gotta go. Should we have dinner tonight? We could cook at your place?"

Houston stalls, "Oh, um...well, they haven't delivered my dining room table yet."

"And they never will if you don't order one." Holly rubs her temples, "You've been here for almost two years, Mitch. When are you going to put down roots?"

Houston shrugs.

Holly shrugs back, "Alright. My place then. I'll see you around seven." She stands and looks around to see if anyone is looking at them. No one is noticing them, so she bends down and kisses Houston on the cheek. "Good luck."

Houston gives her a weak smile and immediately looks back down at the file.
