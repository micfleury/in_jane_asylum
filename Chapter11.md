Later that night, Houston lies in his bed, reading his copy of Emma. He notices that he is only a few pages from the end of his half-eaten copy. He grabs his cell and searches for Emma on Google Books. He's just about to click on the link, but then smiles, ever so slightly, turns off his phone and falls asleep with the book.

The next day at Clover Ridge, Houston walks into the rec room and sees Jacob talking with George. George removes his watch. When he is not looking, Jacob pockets it. After a moment, he seems to go through an internal struggle which ends with him putting the watch back on the table. Anna is standing looking out the window. She turns and smiles at Houston, but just as quickly turns back to the window.

Houston follows her gaze and looks out the window as well. Suddenly, he and Anna are part of a group that includes Harriet, Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston, Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax, and Mr. and Mrs. Elton. Everyone chats animatedly. They walk along holding baskets, which they are filling with strawberries. Anna spends her time in the company of Frank and Harriet, while Houston walks with Jane and Miss Bates. Mr. Weston and Mr. and Mrs. Elton make up the third group. Houston looks back at Anna and Frank with jealousy. He turns to speak to Anna. As Houston turns, he finds himself face to face with Dr. Ashford. They are barely inches apart. Anna is now behind him, still staring out the window. 

Ashford clears his throat and Houston turns toward him. Anna is her usual unaware self. "Dr. Houston? I'd like to meet with you today."

Houston nods, "Yes, sir. After Jacob's session?" He looks back toward the clock on his wall, "Twelve-thirty?"

Ashford agrees.

Houston knocks twice and then enters Ashford's open office. Ashford nods toward the door and Houston takes the hint that he should close it. Houston sits and they stare at each other in silence. Houston picks nervously at his fingernails. Finally Ashford speaks. "Mitchell," Ashford pauses, "Dr. Houston, you've been with us for a  year and a half now."

"Yes, sir."

"So, I'm inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt. I've never had reason to suspect anything untoward or inappropriate in your treatment of any of your patients."

"No, sir. I—"

Ashford clears his throat to cut him off, "Be that as it may, I feel that perhaps Ms. Edwards and Mr. Miller would be better served with another doctor."

"Sir! No, you're wrong. I'm making great strides with both of them. Anna has started interacting outside of her delusion and I feel that we are on the very brink of a breakthrough. And Jacob...Jacob has been speaking with the other patients and just this morning, he managed...not to steal George's watch," He finishes lamely.

"I agree that the progress they are making is significant, but I don't believe that you're a magic man. They can achieve similar milestones with another doctor."

Houston rises, "Dr. Ashford, you say that you want to give me the benefit of the doubt, but your actions say differently. You're branding me. Everyone will suspect that something happened. And nothing did."

Ashford raises one eyebrow and Houston sits again, perched on the edge of the chair.

"Hmmm...okay. I'm going to hold off on any changes for now. But I would advise you to arrange for someone to escort Mr. Miller to his sessions. He does have a tendency to barge in."

"Yes, sir. Definitely. Thank you, Dr. Ashford," Houston looks around, "So, I guess I'll go then. It's Matthew's big day!"

Houston gets up and walks out of the office. Ashford rubs his temples.

Houston walks into the group therapy session. He stands behind Matthew's chair rather than sitting in his own. In the corner, there is a table loaded with cupcakes and some punch. "Everyone, today is a big day for one of us. Matthew is headed home tonight. Matthew, I'm really proud of you. I know this is a difficult step for you, but I really think you're ready. This is a great example to the group.  You give us all something to strive for. Right, folks?"

Everyone in the group claps with varying enthusiasm except for Matthew, who clutches a stress ball in his left hand, and Anna, who is not tuned into her surroundings today. Jacob, at first, rolls his eyes, but eventually smiles and joins in.

"Well, we've got more than just an ovation for you. Jack used his occupational therapy this week to bake us all some cupcakes." Houston gestures toward the snack table and members of the group make their way toward it. Jacob takes Anna's arm and leads her over. Roy follows very closely behind Janice. Matthew hangs back. Houston shakes his hand.

They look over at the snack table where Janice is biting into a chocolate one and has a vanilla one in her other hand. She smiles at Jack with chocolate teeth. "These are  great, Jack. I could eat them all."

Jack smiles back. Anna, who had been standing off to the side, sipping punch, pipes in, "Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me, but you will be limited as to the number, -- only three at once."

There is a collective gasp from the group, even Jacob. Janice stops chewing and tears fill her eyes. She puts the remains of the first and the second cupcake down on the table. She swallows what's in her mouth and speaks very quietly. "I didn't mean that I WOULD eat them all. She's right to think I would, but I wouldn't do that."

Houston walks over to Janice and puts a comforting hand on her back. She continues to mumble to herself as he walks her to the door where he calls for a nurse or orderly. George deals with the uncomfortable situation by disrobing. "Hey! I thought this was a party!"

Jack takes his cupcake and walks toward the door, "Have a great time, Matthew. I'm going to take my cupcake back to my room."

Matthew grabs a cupcake and follows Jack, "Sounds like a great idea."

The others murmur their assent and leave as well. Houston and Anna are the only ones left in the room. Houston steps toward Anna.

With his third step, Houston finds himself back in the field on the strawberry picking trip. For the first time, he is without his book. While the others are loading into carriages, Houston grabs Anna's arm and leads her a little bit away. "Emma, I must  once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?--Emma, I had not thought it possible."

"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me," Anna tries to free herself from Houston's grip.

"I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it—with what candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be so irksome."

Tears have sprung to Anna's eyes, "Oh! I know there is not a better creature in the world: but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her."

"They are blended, I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good. Were she a woman of fortune--" Houston, realizing that he has been speaking words from the novel, shakes his head. The scene remains the same, but his words are now his own. "Anna, if words had no consequence, I'd be out of a job. Just like I can't let George run around naked, I can't let you burst out with any old thing you want to say."

As Anna listens to Houston's scolding, she starts to shake her head as she did before to shut him out of the delusion. The scene starts to fade from the countryside back into the group therapy room. Houston grabs both of Anna's hands and forces her to look at him, "NO!" The scene is fully the countryside again, "Anna, you hurt Janice. You have struck at an already broken heart. I can't let you do that. I've made a mistake treating you. I shouldn't have played your game. I won't do it anymore. If you want to talk to me, it will have to be as Anna. Emma is done."

Anna has begun sobbing. She leans into Houston and he wraps her in a hug.
