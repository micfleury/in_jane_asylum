Houston rises when Laura Barrett enters and offers his hand. "Thanks for coming by, Mrs. Barrett."

"Laura," she corrects.

He invites her to sit down and gestures toward a chair. "Laura, you've heard that Anna has begun her new medication?"

Lauray nods, "Dr. Houston, I know I only asked for Anna to be here for the medication change, but I want Anna to come home. Not whoever she thinks she is right now. Is Anna ready to come home?"

Houston desperately wants to give Laura the response she seeks, but knows he can only offer an apology, "I'm sorry. I don't think we're there yet. But I do feel like we're making progress and I wanted to ask you some questions."

"Sure, anything."

"Thanks. First thing, I have determined what book Anna is uh, working from for lack of a better term. Emma by Jane Austen. Do you remember this book as a favorite of Anna's?"

Laura shakes her head. "No. Actually, I don't remember her reading much except for school. Miss Taylor didn't approve of her reading novels."

Houston gasps, "There's an actual Miss Taylor?"

"No, Dr. Houston," Laura explains. "But, Anna has always talked about her as if she was and I guess we just came to believe it. Once, I was walking past Anna's room and I thought I heard two voices. I opened the door and I saw a strange woman sitting on the bed doing needlepoint. It was just for a second. I ran over to Anna and grabbed her to get her out of the room. As soon as she looked at me, I didn't see a woman anymore. But I swear I saw her."

Laura laughs, "Maybe her craziness is contagious." 

Houston is taken aback, but says nothing. He merely sighs.

"I don't think you're crazy," he reassures her. "I don't think Anna is, for that matter. From my meetings with her, I believe that she is choosing this delusion over real life. What we need to do is convince her that she still has something here to stick around for."

Laura nods in agreement.

Houston continues, "So, I'd like you to come here for regular visits, if you can."

Laura clears her throat, "I want to do whatever I can to help Anna. Thing is...it's almost a two-hour drive to get here. And I have three kids. There's work and school and activities. Would once a week be enough?"

"I wish it could be more, but I think that as long as it's consistent, it will be helpful." Houston rises. "Why don't we go see her now and then we'll expect you again in a week?" Houston heads toward the door.

Laura follows Houston to the rec room where they see Anna, sitting curled up in a chair with her head tucked into her knees. She is mumbling and pulling at her hair. They approach her and Laura calls out to her.

"Anna?" Laura gently calls.

Anna looks up and sees her sister. She slowly stands up and walks toward her. "My dear Isabella…" Anna shakes her head violently and rubs her eyes with her fists. After this brief fit, she looks at her sister again. "Laura. Is it time to go home?"

Laura looks to Houston for guidance. Houston holds up his hand and then turns to Anna. "Anna. You're looking well today."

Anna, in reality, looks the same as she does everyday, although her eyes are maybe not as vacant as usual.

"Laura is here to visit you. She's hoping to make it a weekly thing while you're here."

Before Houston has even finished his sentence, Anna's transformation into Emma has occurred. A new posture, a focus on things not there, and of course the accent. "She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart."

Laura makes to grab her sister, "Anna please!"

Houston puts his hand on Laura's shoulder to hold her back while speaking to Anna. "Anna. I know that you weren't expecting to stay here for more than a few days, but leaving is in your hands. You need to stop these delusions if you want to leave."

They watch as a dozen expressions cross Anna's face. She is clearly struggling. Houston simply observes her but Laura looks on fretfully. Anna eventually speaks as herself. She is shaky and the volume of her voice fluctuates. She is the opposite of when she speaks as Emma–fidgety, cowering, and incoherent. "Daddy held onto me so tight when he was here that it was easy to stay on this side. But now, now, now…"

Laura reaches for Anna's hand and leads her back to her chair, then sits beside her. "Anna. I'm here. You can hold on to me. And the boys, too. We'll all come up next weekend to see you. They'll want to tell you all the news about school and soccer."

Anna, who had been looking at Laura at first, has drifted off again. When Laura finishes, Anna looks up and speaks to no one in particular. "News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile so?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?"

Laura stands up and begins to cry. Houston comes over and puts an arm around her shoulder as he walks her out. Anna stares off into some distance that only she sees.

Shortly after, Houston has returned to host group therapy. The usual cast of characters, minus Anna, sits in the circle. There is an empty chair next to Jacob.

Houston begins, "I know we spend a lot of time dealing with our worst times here. Today, I'd like to try something a little different. I'd like everyone to tell us about his or her best day. Jacob, would you like to start?"

Jacob looks at Houston as if he's been caught at something. Then his expression turns to anger. Houston notices this and tries to calm him.

"Jacob, please. We are all friends here. There is no need to be tense. Just tell us about a day when you were happy."

Jacob snorts and shakes his head, but then sits up a little straighter and starts to speak, "I don't know. Maybe the day I met my father. I was–"

Just then, Travis opens the door and escorts Anna in, seats her next to Jacob and leaves. Anna immediately sits up taller and turns her attention to Jacob. She holds out her hand delicately and smiles, "Mr. Churchill. Your aunt has spared you at last."

Jacob scoots his chair away from Anna. "Look, lady. I already told you that I don't know this Churchill guy. Why don't you just–"

Houston interrupts, "Anna. Jacob is speaking now. Please wait your turn."

Jacob rolls his eyes and crosses his arms. He clamps his jaw, refusing to speak.

"Please, Jacob. Tell us about the day you met your father." 

Jacob flares his nostrils a bit and shoots an angry look at Anna, but starts to speak, "It was the day he got married. How stupid is that? You haven't seen your kid in fourteen years and you invite him to your wedding? But my aunt, his sister, went with me, so at least I knew someone." Jacob pauses, remembering the day.

"And tell us what happened that day to make it such a happy memory," Houston prompts.

Jacob uncrosses his arms and leans forward. "His wife is loaded, so the wedding was like something out of a fairy tale."

Anna interrupts, speaking lines from Emma. "You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings."

Everyone looks at Anna. Jacob is shooting daggers. 

Houston speaks sternly to Anna, "Anna! We are listening only. Please hold your comments."

Anna does not react to the reprimand but neither does she speak again while Jacob finishes his story.

"Go ahead, Jacob."

"Like I said, the wife was loaded. And she wasn't the only one. All her friends and family too. By the end of the day, I had lifted nearly seven hundred dollars." Jacob grins widely to himself while the others show confusion and in some cases disgust. "That was a happy day."

Houston clears his throat and looks at Jacob with an expression meant to convey disappointment. Jacob gives a half smile back and slumps in his seat.

"Jacob, I hope we can talk more about that day in session. Does anyone else have a story to share?"

Anna looks at Jacob and begins speaking, "I have heard her speak of the acquaintance. She is a very elegant young woman."

Everyone sighs.

"Okay, everyone. Let's call it a day. Anna, I'll see you in my office."
