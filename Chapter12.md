Anna continues to sob, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

Ashford enters the room, passing by Holly who has been watching. He steps over to the couple. He taps Houston on the shoulder. Anna continues to apologize. Ashford clears his throat. Houston turns toward him. Anna stops speaking but continues to cry. Ashford crooks his finger at Houston who releases Anna and follows him out of the room. Holly goes over to Anna and shakes her head as she passes Houston.

Houston enters Ashford's office and sits in a chair where he watches Ashford pace back and forth. Ashford is flustered, something Houston's never seen before. He flaps his arms and starts and stops. "An hour! An hour ago! I just--I just can't—You said--And I thought—But—my gut--I knew in my gut. Now what?" He looks at Houston expectantly.

Houston starts to speak, somewhat apologetically but also a little annoyed, "Dr. Ashford, I know you think you saw something, but you didn't. She was upset. She leaned in for a hug. That's all it was."

"That's all? Mitchell, we saw the whole thing. We called to you several times. You were as lost to us as Miss Edwards. What's going on?"

Houston opens and closes his mouth several times but says nothing.

"You said that you were making progress, drawing her out...but it seems that Anna was the one making all the progress...drawing you in."

Houston stands, "It's not like that. I am completely in control of this situation."

Ashford shakes his head, "I don't think that is your call anymore. Anna's sister will be in to visit in two days. I will call her today to apprise her of the situation. Then, we'll all meet and a decision will be made. For now, Anna will stay in her room."

Houston sighs and walks out of the office. He's sitting at his own desk when there is a knock at the door. "Come in."

Janice opens the door. Houston stands and goes to her. "Janice. I'm so glad you came to see me. Are you feeling better? You know that Anna only talks nonsense. She wasn't making a remark about you." Janice sits down in a chair. Houston follows suit.

Janice gives a sad smile to Houston, "Did you know that I used to be beautiful?"

"You still are, Janice. You are a beautiful person."

Janice snorts, "No. I was hot. No one ever believed that I was in my thirties and had a kid. Anyway, a few days after the funeral, I went to Mike's company to pick up stuff from his desk. And I met with his boss, Andy, and we talked about Mike, and he asked me if I wanted to get some coffee," she rummages through her pockets as if looking for something. She pulls out some gum. She looks at it with distaste, shrugs, and puts it in her mouth, "So, we got coffee and talked some more. And we met up a couple of times  a week after that. And when we were leaving, he always hugged me and after a while, I hugged back. Then one day he kissed me–" She starts to cry a little, "And I kissed him back...just for a second. Then I pushed away and just...left. As I was walking back to my car, some construction workers whistled at me...and I wanted to scream at them. 'I'm not a slut. I'm not a cheater!'"

Houston hands her a tissue, "Janice, you didn't do anything wrong. Your husband had died. You weren't cheating."

Janice nods her head but continues to cry.

"What happened next?"

Janice wipes her eyes and nose with the tissue, "I just got in my car to go home. And I caught my reflection in the rear view mirror--hair done, makeup, jewelry--I went home, scrubbed off the makeup and put on some sweats. My house was full of food from family and friends. And I just started eating. And days passed and I was still eating. And the sweats gave me all the room I needed."

Houston leans in so she knows he's still listening.

"After a few weeks, when I went out--no makeup, dirty hair, and those disgusting sweats--for the first time in my life, no one looked at me. Men didn't approach me. I even saw Andy at the coffee shop once and he didn't even recognize me. It hurt, but at the same time it was wonderful. I could just be. No one ever noticed me."

"Until Anna," Houston says softly.

"Until Anna. Dr. Houston, she's practically catatonic and she still saw me."

"No, she didn't. That's what I'm telling you. She was just reciting a line from a novel."

"Maybe she does do that, but her lines usually fit in with what's going on. That Emma is one smart girl."

"Janice, she's not Emma."

"I know. I'm depressed, not crazy. But, I do feel gratitude toward her. She really woke me up. I mean, if someone can see me through all of this, then I guess there really isn't any defense against life. So, I'm not going to fight it anymore. I'm going to learn how to stop this ache." She puts her hand over her heart, "Without giving myself a stomach ache."

"It sounds like you were working toward this before the incident with Anna," Houston prompts.

Janice smiles knowingly, "Yeah...you don't have to be mad at her."

"No, I didn't mean anything like that. I don't get mad at my patients, Janice. A therapist can care about his patients, but still has to take a clinical approach."

"If you say so. Gum?" Janice pulls another piece from her pocket and offers it to Houston.

Houston takes it and starts to chew thoughtfully.
