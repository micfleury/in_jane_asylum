After Houston leaves Anna's room, he forgets about visiting the other patients in the rec room and before he knows it, he's sitting in his driveway, watching the rain pour down upon his car. Lightning gives quick bursts of illumination to the darkening sky, but he stares at nothing, lost in the rain drops, lost in his mind.

—-----------------------------------

Miles away, Anna stares out the window at the same storm. The rain drops are so heavy that she can't possibly see past an inch and yet she smiles, just barely.

—-----------------------------------

Houston continues to stare out the window. He has no idea how long he has been sitting there, but night has fallen. He squints for a moment, as if trying to focus on something beyond the storm, beyond the darkness. Suddenly, he smacks his forehead, grabs his bag, and climbs out of his car. He uses the bag as an umbrella, but it doesn't work and he's standing soaked in his living room. Suddenly, he's not in his living room. He sees himself scolding Anna again.

He blinks furiously, trying to stop the images that keep rushing past. Houston and Anna walking happily through the strawberry fields. Houston and Anna sitting on a blanket, eating the strawberries. Houston sitting by the fire with Emma and her father.

The phone rings. After the third or fourth ring, Houston notices and answers. He doesn't say anything, not quite sure how a cell phone ended up in the pocket of his waistcoat.

"Dr. Houston?" he hears a woman's voice on the other end.

"This is. Who am I speaking to?" Houston rubs at his face.

"This is Laura Barrett."

"Mrs. Barrett? Is everything okay? Is there a problem?" Houston looks over at Emma, who is staring back at him, completely perplexed. Houston turns away and when he does, he's back in his living room.

Laura responds, "I'm not sure I can wait for Anna to get better–"

"Laura, I'm still confident that Anna can be brought back. Dr. Ashford knows what he's doing."

"That's why I'm calling. I don't want Dr. Ashford to treat her."

"No, no, no," Houston shakes his head vehemently. "What? She needs treatment."

"I told you before that I wanted Anna back. But, I don't know if that's the right thing anymore. It's so much work for her to be Anna. Maybe we've been trying to hold her in the wrong world."

"Laura, there's only one world, and I can't advocate a treatment plan that involves ignoring the problem."

"Dr. Houston, you need to stop talking doc-talk for a minute and listen to me. Anna's not sick. She doesn't need treatment. She's found her own path. And now she's just waiting for her white knight. Take care of her." 

The phone call ends and Houston hears nothing else. He falls onto the couch and covers his face with his hands. He lets out a roar to match the thunder outside. He reaches for his bag and pulls out his book and heads for the kitchen. Houston puts the book down on the counter and scribbles something down on a piece of paper. He leaves it on the counter and picks up the book. He takes one step and then drops the book back on the counter. He then makes his way out the door, into the storm.

The rain will not relent, but he's still soaked from before, so doesn't hesitate to get out of the car the minute he parks in the nearly empty parking lot of the hospital. He rushes toward the hospital doors.

Just inside the doors he is stopped by a security guard, "Dr. Houston, it's awfully late to be --"

Houston holds up his hand, "It's urgent."

The security guard stands down and Houston dashes on, sprinting down the halls of the hospital. A nurse calls out to him, "She hasn't moved." 

He finally slows in front of a long corridor of darkened rooms. The patients are all asleep. He looks through the glass of Anna's door and sees that she is still staring out the window.

Drops of rain, having been caught in his hair, continue to slide down his face as he walks into her room. She turns. Houston slowly makes his way to her. His hand slowly reaches out, shaking, and touches hers. A tear slides down his face, though it's lost amongst the drops of rain.

His mouth moves as if words are on the tip of his tongue but refusing to come out, "I... I...." He pauses, trying not to let his emotions overcome him. "I cannot make speeches, Emma."

Anna's fingers tighten around Houston's, ever so slightly. White light fills the room. They are now standing outdoors, in the garden. Houston, dressed in 18th century garb, continues to grip Anna's hands and stare into her eyes. Houston repeats himself, "I cannot make speeches, Emma."

Anna winks at him and squeezes his hands, "You said no more Emma. It's Anna."
"Anna," Houston smiles. "If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me. I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it. Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Em—"

Anna shoots him a look.

"Anna, as well as you have borne with them. The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover. But you understand me. Yes, you see, you understand my feelings and will return them if you can. At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice."

Anna's eyes fill with tears, "So, what happens now?"

"I don't know. But, as long as this is where you live," Houston gestures to their surroundings and then taps Anna's head, "then this is where I'm going to live too. Laura didn't want you left alone and told me I should come find you."

Anna pouts a bit, "So, you were ordered to come?"

"Hardly. I was released from the obligation to stay away."

Anna speaks softly, "Ask me again."

"Marry me?"

"Yes," Anna reaches up and pulls Houston close to her. They softly kiss.

—-----------------------------------------

Travis knocks once and then opens the door to Anna's room. Anna and Houston are perfectly still, holding hands and looking into each other's eyes.

"Doc? Dr. Houston?" He backs out and heads for Dr. Ashford's office.

—-----------------------------------------

Ashford walks through Houston's house searching for clues, "What is going on, Mitchell?" On the kitchen table he spots a note. He picks it up and reads aloud, "We're not lost. Please don't try to find us." Ashford pauses, the note in hand. He turns around and notices something else. A book on the counter... Emma. A curious smile forms across his face. Ashford whispers to himself, "Mr. Knightley, I presume?"

—-----------------------------------------

A clergyman stands before a great crowd. All are present, Harriet, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, John Knightley and so on... And at the center of it all, standing at the altar, are Anna and Houston - Emma and Mr. Knightley. They stand before their friends, perfectly framed by a beautiful white arc above them, surrounded by stunningly green grass that stretches out for miles in every direction. They look as if in a dream.

"You may kiss the bride."

Houston leans closer to Anna. She whispers to him, "Mr. Knightley."

"Seems a bit formal for husband and wife," he replies while smiling.

"I can't call you George--brings back bad memories," Anna shudders and laughs.

"I love you, Mrs. Knightley."

"And I you."

They kiss. Everyone applauds. Anna and Houston smile as their lips part, completely in love. They start up the aisle, passing all of their friends and family members, their hands tightly interlocked.

—-----------------------------------------

Travis walks into Anna's room once again. She and Houston are in side-by-side hospital beds, both lying still, eyes shut, bodies unmoving. Their hands are clasped and they both have a slight smile on their faces.
